## ðŸ“° Commands

These are the current accepted commands. As the bot is still in development, some of these might be a little fucked.They should however, work as intended.
The command itself is the one with the `!` in front of it, while any other parameters is described inside the `<>`. Happy dying! ðŸ’€
